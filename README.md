<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project entails the design and implementation of a comprehensive FullStack Social web application built using the MERN tech stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The application seeks to emulate the basic features of a typical social media platform, offering a user-friendly environment where users can share and interact with content.

**Key Features**:

- **Reading posts**: Users will be able to explore the posts made by others. This feature provides a comprehensive view of various shared content, allowing users to keep up-to-date with recent posts, stories, and updates.

  

- **Like posts**: Users can show their support or agreement with a post by liking it. This feature is fundamental in any social media platform, giving users the ability to express their sentiment about a post non-verbally.

- **Make posts**: Users will have the ability to create and share their own content. This can be in the form of text, images, or videos. This feature allows users to share their thoughts, ideas, or experiences with the community.

- **Register**: Before utilizing the application, users will need to register. This process will involve users providing some basic information about themselves to create a personal profile. This is the initial step to creating a unique identity within the platform.

- **User authentication**: An essential feature that will protect user data and maintain platform integrity. This will involve the use of secure login systems to authenticate users. This feature will ensure only authorized users can access specific resources, perform actions like making posts, and interact with other users' content.
